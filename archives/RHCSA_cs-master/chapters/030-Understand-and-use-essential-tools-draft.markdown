# Understand and use essential tools

## Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax
  
This is first requirement should stop anyone who may not know, or may have never used a shell prompt from attempting the test. If you can open your terminal, navigate and type commands then you have accomplished this. If not, then you should check out the basics and start there.

Alternatively

**Ctrl+Alt+F1** to **F6** are the virtual consoles provided by the getty/agetty programs. Ctrl+Alt+F7 is the console where your X server is running. The GUI (Gnome/KDE or any other) runs over X. So to get back into your GUI window manager: type: 
**Ctrl+Alt+F7**.

## Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)
  
Input output redirection is one of the base skills you will need as a sysadmin. On the exam you will have to be able to redirect data from one command into another, and/or into a file.

Some examples:

	$ echo "this is input" > file.txt

or

	$ cat /var/log/messages | less

You can easily redirect input / output to any file other than the screen. This is achieved in Linux using input and output redirection symbols:

* ">" Output redirection
* "<" Input redirection

Using a combination of these symbols and the standard file descriptors you can achieve complex redirection tasks quite easily.

* ">" overwright
* "<" send into a command or file
* ">>" append
* "<<" append into a command or file
* "|" funnel into
* "2>" redirect errors
* "2>&1" redirect errors to std out
  
## Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text

RHCSA requirements state that you must know how to use grep to analyze text. This is actually going to be pretty necessary to do many administration tasks on a daily basis.

Grep returns any lines that have characters, words, or expressions that match your query.

Basic usage examples of this include:

* Find "Permission Denied" entries in a log file

	$ grep -r "Permission Denied" /path/to/logfile/

* Find "Permission Denied" entries in a log file by using output redirection

	$ cat /path/to/file/ | grep "Permission Denied"

## Access remote systems using ssh and VNC

### SSH

SSH is such an integrated part of this exam that its kind of weird that this is one of the official requirements. But nonetheless there are a number of different options that you can apply to make you more efficient in exam.

* Basic ssh access is simple:

	$ ssh user@host

* ssh to a custom port:

	$ ssh -p port_number user@host

* ssh bringing X (required to run programs like system-config-users remotely)

	$ ssh -X user@host

* ssh as another user (another way)

	$ ssh -l user host

* Display debugging messages as it connects. Useful if you have having some issues connecting to a certain machine.

	$ ssh -v user@host

Those are the main options for ssh, as always "man ssh" to see all the other magic.

### VNC

**On the remote machine, that you will be connecting to, you should have tigervnc-server installed.**

	$ yum install tigervnc-server

This puts a config file on your remote machine in /etc/sysconfig/vncservers

	VNCSERVERS="2:myusername"
	VNCSERVERARGS[2]="-geometry 800x600 -nolisten tcp -nohttpd"

Aside from changing "username" you want it to look like this. All we did to change it, is remove the "-localhost" directive. This would have restricted us from connecting from a remote system without a tunnel setup. Since this is an exam and not the real world, we can disable that.

Set up your password on the remote machine by running

	$ vncpasswd

And finally start your vncserver

	$ vncserver :1

The output should look like this:

	[root@rhel6 ~]# vncserver :1
	New 'rhel6.local:1 (root)' desktop is rhel6.local:1
	Starting applications specified in /root/.vnc/xstartup
	Log file is /root/.vnc/rhel6.local:1.log

The default vnc client on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is tigervnc. If it is not already installed on the system:

	$ yum install tigervnc

To connect to the newly setup vncserver just type:

	$ vncviewer rhel6.local:5901

(replace rhel6.local with your remote host)

## Log in and switch users in multiuser runlevels.

If you have followed along to this point, you have logged in, and most likely been in either runlevel 3 or runlevel 5. Runlevels determine how much of the systems services are actually running. Most common runlevel for servers is going to be 3, most services that are not GUI oriented (including the Gnome Desktop) are turned off. Runlevel 5 is what you see when you boot into the desktop environment.

Switching between these levels is fairly straightforward. To switch to runlevel 3 type:

	$ init 3

Then to see what runlevel you are in type:

	$ runlevel
Switching between users, also straightforward. To switch to bob, assuming bob is a user on the system:

	$ su - bob  #note: We put the dash in there to gain the users login profile.
				# So if I switched to root and didnt use the - operator, 
				#I wouldn't have /usr/sbin in my path.

Switching to root is a common task.

	$ su -

## Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2.

###tar

Create a tar file from a folder called test1:

	$ tar cvf test1.tar test1

* c = create
* v = verbose
* f = file

Extract test1.tar

	$ tar xvf test1.tar

* x = extract
* v = verbose
* f = file

List contents of tar archive

	$ tar tf test1.tar


###star

Man page for star: 

	man star

###gzip

This is most commonly used in combination with tar, using the z switch. Tar itself does not compress, it just packs.

	$ tar cvzf test1.tar.gz test1

Although it can be used by itself

	$ gzip test1

gunzip test1.gz

note that this does not preserve the .gz file, it extracts it and removes it.

###bzip2

bzip2 uses a different algorithm to compress files than the other tools, but very similar options

Create a bzip2 file

	$ bzip2 test1

note that this does not preserve the original file(s), it will compress and delete the uncompressed version also does not compress directories, only files.
Check out the man page:

	man bzip2

## Create and edit text files.

Using a command line text editor is a skill that is absolutely necessary. Without it most tasks cannot be performed. The default editor used it vim. vim is a enhanced version of vi, which is not quite as pretty as vim.

To use vim simply type vim and then the filename

	$ vim filename.txt

There are options that can be given such as:

* -R Open in read-only
* -b Start in binary mode

There is also a list of options for using vim once you are editing, to move around and actually edit. It may seem cumbersome at first, but once you are used to vim you will love it.

Check out the man page for more options:

	man vim

## Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories.

Administering a system requires moving, copying, and deleting files and directories. These are tasks that you will encounter on a constant basis and are essential to the RHCE.

Some of the most important commands are the ones that we will list below.

### ls - List contents of a directory

list the contents of the home directory.

	$ ls /home/

###cp - Copy a file or group of files to another location on the machine.

copy file1 as file2

	$ cp file1 file2

### mv - Move a file or directory

move a directory to the /tmp directory

	$ mv directory /tmp/

### cd - Change directory

* navigate into the /home/ directory

	$ cd /home/

* navigate from home into the /etc directory, using the .. to reverse out of the directory

	$ cd ../etc/

### rm - remove files or directories.

* remove file1

	$ rm file1

* remove directory with all contents (Caution when using this!)

	$ rm -rf directory1/

### touch - create a new blank file

* create a blank file named myfile.txt

	$ touch myfile.txt

### mkdir - create a new directory

* create a directory in the present working directory

	$ mkdir directory1

###  pwd - Get the present working directory

* find the present working directory. Handy when you need to see where in the system you are.
	
	$ pwd     
	$ /home/david/

### head- Display first lines of a file, default to 10 lines

* display the first 10 lines of file1

	head file1
	
	::bash

* display the first 50 lines of file1

	head -50 file1


### tail -Display last lines of a file, default to 10 lines

* display the last 10 lines of file1

	tail file1

* display the last 50 lines of file1   

	tail -50 file1

## Create hard and soft links.

### Hard Links

A hard link is a link where two files are really the same file.

Watch how when we create a file, and link to it with a hard link, the inodes (exact location on the harddisk) are the same.

	$ touch file.txt
	$ ln file.txt file1.txt
	$ ls -li file*
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file1.txt
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file.txt

When we create a third file linking it to the original, we see the same thing. They all are have an inode of 524594.

	$ ln file.txt file2.txt
	$ ls -li file*
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 3 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file1.txt
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 3 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file2.txt
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 3 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file.txt

What happens if we delete the original file?

	$ rm file.txt
	rm: remove regular empty file 'file.txt'? y
	$ ls -li file*
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file1.txt
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 Mar 21 12:54 file2.txt

As you can see, the other two files are in tact and have not been removed, even though the original file is gone. That is because they are all the same file, when you make a hard link to it you are just putting another reference to it with a different name. Until the last file with that inode gets deleted, that file lives on.

Lets put some text in file2.txt and see what happens

	$ echo "things" >> file2.txt
	$ ls -li file*
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 7 Mar 21 13:01 file1.txt
	524594 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 7 Mar 21 13:01 file2.txt
	$ cat file1.txt 
	things
	$ cat file2.txt 
	things

As you can see, the files both grew to 7 bytes, and when we look inside each one, they both have the same text. That's because they are the same.

### Soft Links

A soft link is much different from a hard link. Most people relate hard links to shortcuts in Windows. When you put a shortcut on your Desktop, it is just a link to the something on your computer. If you delete it no biggie, its just a link. Soft links are the same way.

	$ touch testfile.txt
	$ ln -s testfile.txt testfile1.txt
	$ ls -li testfile*
	524726 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Mar 21 13:11 testfile1.txt -> testfile.txt
	524725 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root  0 Mar 21 13:11 testfile.txt

Here we created a file, testfile.txt, and then ran ln -s to create a soft link. When we ran ls -li we see that now the inodes are different, and testfile1.txt shows highlighted with an arrow to testfile.txt.

OK, so now lets repeat what we did above for hard links. I will make another soft link, linking to the original file testfile.txt and call it testfile2.txt. Then I'll delete the original and ls -li

	$ ln -s testfile.txt testfile2.txt
	$ ls -li testfile*
	524726 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Mar 21 13:11 testfile1.txt -> testfile.txt
	524727 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Mar 21 13:15 testfile2.txt -> testfile.txt
	524725 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root  0 Mar 21 13:11 testfile.txt
	$ rm testfile.txt 
	rm: remove regular empty file 'testfile.txt'? y
	$ ls -li testfile*
	524726 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Mar 21 13:11 testfile1.txt -> testfile.txt # Imagine RED here
	524727 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Mar 21 13:15 testfile2.txt -> testfile.txt # Imagine RED here

If we try and cat the two files, to see the contents, we get an error. We can no longer access these files, they are broken links.

	$ cat testfile*
	cat: testfile1.txt: No such file or directory
	cat: testfile2.txt: No such file or directory

## List, set, and change standard ugo/rwx permissions.

Permissions rule on compooters. Controlling them, essential. Linux has a number of different tools to do this, we list the essentials for the exam here.

### ls

This is one of the most common commands used when probing a filesystem. ls lists the files in a directory, and the -l switch shows permissions, ownership, size, and date modified 

	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-------. 1 root root  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

### chmod

Permissions are as follows:

* 1 execute
* 2 write
* 4 read

..or in letter format

* x execute
* w write
* r read

note: the first bit is reserved for type, files are -, directories are d, links are l

For example, to change all three above files to 777 or readable, writable, and executable by all:

	# chmod changes permission bits, either with numeric or letter permission options.
	[root@rhel6 ~]# chmod 777 ./*
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root  5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

A more reasonable permissions set would be to allow others to read files, but only allow the owner to read, write, and execute.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chmod 644 ./*
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

Directories usually have a similar permissions set. They allow owner to rwx, but everyone else to rx. 755 would be the numerical value.

If directories are not executable, you cannot change into them with cd. cd essentially executes itself on the directory when you use it.

If we want to use the letter format as opposed to numbers. we combine the ugo/rwx to apply permissions. To give the group permissions to execute install.log we combine g+x:

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chmod g+x install.log
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 nobody nobody  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r-xr--. 1 david  root   15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root   david   5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

### chown

chown is used to change ownership of files and directories.

Using the same group of files, we can change the owner from root to david on install.log.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chown david.david install.log
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root  root   1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 david david 15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root  root   5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

We can also change just group on a file, to allow the group certain permissions. Here we change install.log.syslog to be owned by group david, but still owner is root.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chown root.david install.log.syslog 
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root  root   1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 david david 15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root  david  5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

If we don't want anyone to see have access, we could change it to a user like nobody. In this case, everyone would be able to read it, but nobody could write and execute anaconda-ks.config.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chown nobody.nobody anaconda-ks.cfg 
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 nobody nobody  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 david  david  15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root   david   5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

### chgrp

chgrp does the same thing as chown does, except it only changes the group. Handy if you just want to apply group permissions to a group of files that have various owners.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# chgrp root install.log
	[root@rhel6 ~]# ls -l
	total 28
	-rw-r--r--. 1 nobody nobody  1403 Mar 21 15:40 anaconda-ks.cfg
	-rw-r--r--. 1 david  root   15932 Mar 21 15:39 install.log
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root   david   5337 Mar 21 15:37 install.log.syslog

## Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc.

Man pages, docs, and info are all saving graces on the exams (Thanks to Gianluca[^030-1] for this tips).

The most commonly used help pages are man pages.

	$ man vim

This will give you the manual pages, with descriptions of the options, examples, and information about the application. If you don't remember exactly what man page you need, but you know what utility you are trying to use you can search man pages.

For example, lets find all man pages relating to Ruby.

	[root@rhel6 ~]# man -k ruby
	erb (1)              - an embedded Ruby language interpreter
	erb1.8 (1)           - an embedded Ruby language interpreter
	erb1.9.1 (1)         - an embedded Ruby language interpreter
	gem (1)              - the front end to RubyGems
	gem1.8 (1)           - the front end to RubyGems
	gem1.9.1 (1)         - the front end to RubyGems
	irb (1)              - interactive ruby
	irb1.8 (1)           - interactive ruby
	irb1.9.1 (1)         - interactive ruby
	rake1.9.1 (1)        - a ruby build program with capabilities similar to make
	rdoc (1)             - Generate documentation from Ruby script files
	rdoc1.8 (1)          - Generate documentation from Ruby script files
	rdoc1.9.1 (1)        - Generate documentation from Ruby script files
	ri (1)               - Ruby Information at your fingertips
	ri1.8 (1)            - Ruby Information at your fingertips
	ri1.9.1 (1)          - Ruby Information at your fingertips
	ruby (1)             - Interpreted object-oriented scripting language
	ruby1.8 (1)          - Interpreted object-oriented scripting language
	ruby1.9.1 (1)        - Interpreted object-oriented scripting language
	testrb (1)           - Automatic runnter for Test::Unit of Ruby
	testrb1.8 (1)        - Automatic runnter for Test::Unit of Ruby
	testrb1.9.1 (1)      - Automatic runnter for Test::Unit of Ruby

This is helpful output of results from the search. Really helpful in situations that you forgot the name of a certain utility.

Info is nearly identical, referencing the info docs. Its not quite as nice to use, and therefore is not as popular.

You could also get information from the /usr/share/docs. Here you can find other information about the program itself, or that particular version. The following output is a typical doc directory.

	[root@rhel6 yum-3.2.27]# pwd
	/usr/share/doc/yum-3.2.27
	[root@rhel6 yum-3.2.27]# ls
	AUTHORS  ChangeLog  COPYING  INSTALL  README  TODO
As you can see its very different, simply text files with license, readme, install instructions, etc. For most of your referencing in an exam situation, use the man pages.

Or you can simply use:

	$ ls -l /usr/share/doc | grep ruby
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 ott 21 11:58 libmysql-ruby
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 ott 21 11:59 libruby
	drwxr-xr-x 10 root root  4096 ott 24 19:21 libruby1.8
	drwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 libruby1.9.1
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 libruby1.9.1-dbg
	drwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 ott 24 19:22 libtcltk-ruby1.8
	drwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 libtcltk-ruby1.9.1
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 ott 21 11:58 ruby

	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 ruby1.9.1
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 ruby1.9.1-dev
	drwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 ruby1.9.1-examples
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 feb 23 18:59 ruby1.9.1-full

	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 ott 21 11:58 ruby-mysql

**Exam tip: If you dont get any output from man pages, try running the following command, which will build the man pages.**

	# first check for the package
	[root@rhel6 ~]# rpm -qi man
	# then if its installed try
	[root@rhel6 ~]# makewhatis &
